# Android-Application-for-Handwritten-text-detection

The proposed project is a mobile application that detects handwritten text from an image and 
converts it to speech. The application aims to provide a user-friendly and accessible solution 
for individuals with visual impairments or dyslexia to easily access written information.

FEATURES:
Image Import: The system will allow the user to capture images of handwriting text by 
importing images from the device's gallery.

Handwriting Text Selection: The system will use advanced image processing techniques to 
detect and segment the handwriting text from the image. The user will be able to select the text 
region manually or use an automated selection algorithm.

Handwritten Text Recognition: The system will use machine learning algorithms to recognize 
the handwriting in the selected text region. The recognition algorithm will be optimized for the 
specific handwriting style and language that the application is intended to work with.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: The system will use a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis technique to 
convert the recognized text to speech. The synthesized speech will be adjusted for the target 
language and accent.

Image Editing: The system will provide basic image editing tools, such as cropping to enhance 
the image quality for better handwriting recognition.
These features will make the proposed system for handwriting detection from an image and 
conversion to voice an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly application for individuals with 
visual impairments
